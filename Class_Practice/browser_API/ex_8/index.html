<!-- Create the following folder/file structure:
/ex_8
  |-- index.html
index.html
Copy and paste the code from the previous exercise
Refactor the code to math the new requirements:
Now we need to keep track of how many numbers the user input
Once the user doesn't want to add any more numbers show the following message:
The final result is: %result%
The user input %numbers% numbers
The average is: %average% -->
